# First try with the biggest heading, comparable to HTMLs H1
## Subheading - You will need this, too
### Subsubheading - Sometimes useful, but use with care
#### So this is the fourth heading type and now it is starting to get complicated to read your document
##### With the fifth heading you enter new territory - the territory of TL;DR
###### In the sixth heading you can write whatever you like - noone will read this
So now let's compare the sixth heading with LaTeX style headings. LaTeX article stops at level 3 headings:
\part
\section
\subsection
\subsubsection
and that's it. It does however offer another way to sort content in your sections by providing
\paragraph
\subparagraph
Do not add too much clutter and try to keep your files readable. Thanks.
